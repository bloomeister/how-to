# SOLID

In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

-   S: The **S**ingle-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

-   O: The **O**penâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

-   L: The **L**iskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

-   I: The **I**nterface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

-   D: The **D**ependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
